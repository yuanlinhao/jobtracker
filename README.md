## 🧠 Why This App?

Most job tracking tools act like glorified spreadsheets — static, cold, and passive. But job hunting is dynamic and emotional. It's a full-time job with highs, lows, and constant motion. This app reflects that reality:

- 🧩 **Drag-and-drop Kanban board** to mirror real-world progress.
- 🔖 **Custom tagging system** to adapt to your personal strategy.
- 💬 **Detail modals and notes** to keep track of interviews, thoughts, and follow-ups.
- 🗑️ **Soft-deletes** to help archive past applications without losing context.
