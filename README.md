##  Motivation

Most job tracking tools act like glorified spreadsheets â€” static, cold, and passive. But job hunting is dynamic and emotional. It's a full-time job with highs, lows, and constant motion. I built this app to reflect that reality and to support others going through the same grind.

- **Custom tagging system** to adapt to your personal job hunt strategy
